# ArrayListInJava
Java ArrayList class uses a dynamic array for storing the elements. It is like an array, but there is no size limit. We can add or remove elements anytime. So, it is much more flexible than the traditional array. It is found in the java.util package.The ArrayList in Java can have the duplicate elements also. It implements the List interface so we can use all the methods of List interface here. The ArrayList maintains the insertion order internally.
